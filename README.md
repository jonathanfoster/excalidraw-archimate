# Excalidraw Archimate Libraries

The [ArchiMate Enterprise Architecture modeling language](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate3-doc/index.html)
provides a uniform representation for diagrams that describe Enterprise Architectures.

## Motivation Elements

[Motivation elements](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate3-doc/ch-Motivation-Elements.html) are used to
model the motivations, or reasons, that guide the design or change of an Enterprise Architecture.

The following table gives an overview of the motivation elements, with their definitions.

| Element     | Definition                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stakeholder | Represents the role of an individual, team, or organization (or classes thereof) that represents their interests in the effects of the architecture. |
| Driver      | Represents an external or internal condition that motivates an organization to define its goals and implement the changes necessary to achieve them. |
| Assessment  | Represents the result of an analysis of the state of affairs of the enterprise with respect to some driver.                                          |
| Goal        | Represents a high-level statement of intent, direction, or desired end state for an organization and its stakeholders.                               |

| Principle   | Represents a statement of intent defining a general property that applies to any system in a certain context in the architecture.                    |
| Requirement | Represents a statement of need defining a property that applies to a specific system as described by the architecture.                               |
| Constraint  | Represents a limitation on aspects of the architecture, its implementation process, or its realization.                                              |
| Meaning     | Represents the knowledge or expertise present in, or the interpretation given to, a concept in a particular context.                                 |
